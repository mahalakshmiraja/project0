Objective:
This project is about exploring HTML,CSS,SASS and BootStrap to create a Website.

Description:
    Created a website on my recent trip to Illinois
    The Website has 4 .html pages, Each one has content about the place and experience with pictures.
    HTML5 is used with tags to create tables, lists, links etc apart from the basic tags like div,span.
    CSS properties like: color,font style, background, alignment, padding, margins, #id, .class selector etc were used in a seperate stylesheet.
    Also the stylesheet includes @media query.
    BootStrap 4.1 is used for grid layout, glyphicons, carousel.
    SASS is used with variable, nesting and inheritance properties.
