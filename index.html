                    <div class="ex1"> One of my topic of interest is travelling. In this webpage i will be sharing about my recent trip to Chicago.
                    It was a two day trip. I had an awesome experience in this old city with huge architectural excellence along the lake of Michigan and also drove 90 miles away from the city to hike a "starved" treasure.
                    There are lots to explore in Chicago. It's really a beautiful city ! The downtown itself has enormous attractions for visitors from all over the world. The huge park along the lake of Michigan is where you can find a spectacular crowd of all ages enjoying the summer. There is a bean shaped mirror kind of structure in the park called as the Cloud Gate is where your brain invokes creativity to capture ingenius photographs.
                    Then there are live musical fest,exhibitions happening throught the evenings of summer. Typically you can spend more than a day to view the attractions in the park itself.
                    There are museums, famous art institute to brush up your brain with loads of information.</div>
