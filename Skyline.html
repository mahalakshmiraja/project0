        <h2>Skyline of Chicago</h2>

        <span>

            The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 is said to have literally gutted the downtown area, later Chicago gained its most famous modern skyscrapers, including three of the tallest: the Sears Tower, the Aon Center, and the John Hancock Center.
            To explore the skyscrappers of the city, there were many ways but i preferred to take a guided tour by foot or ferry.
            Then i took a speed boat ferry to view the skyline from lake Michigan. I thought the 75 minutes tour would be boring and took a 30 minutes ferry expecting a thrilling ride (Wrong decision !!).
            I would say it was not worth the money, few people in the boat even made sure to seat in places where no splashing was expected,since it was a speedboat ride, but nothing as such happened.
            There were also many view points to see the skyline.

        <p>Architectural excellence of Chicago is a perfect combination of modern skyscrapers and 19th century buildings </p>
