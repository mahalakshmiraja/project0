            <h2>Starved Rock State Park</h2>
            <div class="col-sm-12">
            Starved rock state park is a must visit place for anyone who loves hiking.
            From busy streets of the city and our routine schedule in life, it's always necessary to take a break and enjoy mother nature.
            The majesty of greeneries with wild canyons, huge trees, the beauty of limitless ocean that never touches the sky.
            Nature has given us a lot to enjoy,cherish and protect, but most of us don't mind about the last one ! (May be that would be the content of my next website !!)
            Okay, let get on our backpack with water,snack and a small towel(It's humid in summer).
            The state park of Illinois is located around 70 miles from chicago Ohare airport. From the flat lands of Illinois you can find a wild state park to explore, has canyon made from glacial melt water, scenic trails, panoramic views from bluff points and an interesting  historical background.

            <h2>History behind the Name:</h2>
            <div class="col-sm-12">
                The park derives its name from a Native American legend. In the 1760s, Chief Pontiac of the Ottawa tribe, was attending a tribal council meeting. At this council of the Illinois and the Pottawatomie, an Illinois-Peoria tribe stabbed Chief Pontiac. Vengeance arose in Pontiac's followers. A great battle started. The Illinois, fearing death, took refuge on the great rock. After many days, the remaining Illinois died of starvation giving this historic park its name - Starved Rock.

            <h2>Trials and Hikes</h2>
            <div class="col-sm-12">
                There is a visitor centre from where you can collect trial map of the state park and start hiking !
                There are different level of trials in the state park. Starting from an easy trial of 0.3 to 4.7 miles one way from visitor center.
                I took a medium loop covering starved rock, french canyon, wildcat canyon, lover's leap, eagle cliff and beehive overlook.
                The French Canyon is worth the trial for its mesmerising beauty. It also depends on the season and rain to see the beauty of each canyon.
